.SS "int ChipChipArray::main (intargc, char **argv)"
This program was used before \fBcv_shape\&.cpp\fP was written to find HSV ranges for the different color blocks\&. This is a slightly modified version of some code written by Shermal Fernando in the blog post 'Color Detection & Object Tracking' at http://opencv-srf.blogspot.com/2010/09/object-detection-using-color-seperation.html"\&.

.SS "\fBColor\fP ChipChipArray::ScanQR ()"
This function manuvers arm to look at the QR code on a train car as the robot is backing up to the car\&. It attempts to find the code in multiple images before finally throwing an exeption if a code is not found\&. If multiple codes are found, it returns a single Color by (seemingly) arbitrary decision\&.
.PP
This function is based on code written by Michael Young (https://github.com/ayoungprogrammer/WebcamCodeScanner)\&.
