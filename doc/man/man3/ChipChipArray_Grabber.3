.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class finds blocks, identifies them, and sorts them according to color, size, and zone\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 19 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "ChipChipArray::Grabber::Grabber (\fBZone\fPzone, \fBSide\fPside)"
Initializes the class according to the side and zone and extends the robotic arm into position\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIzone\fP the zone (A, B, or C) for which to pick up blocks\&.
.br
\fIside\fP the side from which the robot is moving and the position of the blocks (right or left) in the view of the camera to pick up first

Definition at line 157 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "ChipChipArray::Grabber::~Grabber ()"
Destructs the class and retracts the arm\&.

Definition at line 180 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Close ()"
Closes the \fBGrabber\fP\&. Retracts the arm and closes the camera\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 184 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Discard ()\fC [protected]\fP"
Takes block currently in the arm's pinchers and places to side of robot opposite the loading zone\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 189 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Extend ()\fC [protected]\fP"
Sets arm to generic position roughly right above a stack of blocks\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 193 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Grab (\fBBlockPosition\fPpos)\fC [protected]\fP"
Picks up block by ezaming how much it fills up the camera image and where its edges are\&. It is then decided where to grab the block, and the block is picked up\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIpos\fP whether the (half-)block is closer to the robot (FRONT) or farther away (BACK)\&.

.SS "\fBResult\fP ChipChipArray::Grabber::Load ()"
Loads a block(s) (if possible) at the robot's current position\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of half and whole blocks loaded

.PP
Definition at line 201 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "\fBBlock\fP ChipChipArray::Grabber::LocateBlock ()"
Finds the block to pick up\&. Color and block size are contained in this class\&.
.PP
the block to pick up based on the Side given 
.PP
Definition at line 205 of file Grabber\&.hpp\&.
.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Place (\fBColor\fPcolor)\fC [protected]\fP"
Puts block in slot according to color\&. Zones B and C only\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIthe\fP slot into which to place the block 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void ChipChipArray::Grabber::Place (\fBColor\fPcolor, \fBBlockPosition\fPpos)\fC [protected]\fP"
Puts half-blocks in the unloader according to whether there is already a half-block in the corresponding slot\&. Zone B only\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcolor\fP the slot into which to place the block
.br
\fIpos\fP the block position (FRONT/BACK)\&. BACK denotes there is already a half-block stored in the slot, as the FRONT blocks are picked up first\&.
